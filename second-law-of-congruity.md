# Second Law of Congruity  
**Law of Degradation under Loss of Proportionality**

## Statement

When proportionality between Energy, Information, Structure, and Functional Value is violated, a system necessarily enters a regime of degradation.

This degradation does not arise from external perturbation alone, but from the internal inability of the system to maintain coherent scaling across its domains.

Loss of Congruity induces structural cost.

---

## Description

As congruity decreases, the system compensates by increasing expenditure in one or more domains:

- Excess energy dissipation  
- Information noise or loss  
- Structural rigidity or fragmentation  
- Decline of functional value or adaptability  

These effects are not independent failures, but coupled manifestations of the same structural imbalance.

The system may continue to operate temporarily, but only by consuming additional resources or compressing future capacity.

---

## Irreversibility Regimes

Beyond a certain loss of proportionality, degradation becomes self-reinforcing:

- Compensatory costs exceed functional gains  
- Feedback loops amplify incoherence  
- Structural repair becomes less effective over time  

At this stage, degradation is not caused by damage accumulation, but by scaling mismatch.

## Scope

This law is descriptive, not predictive.

It does not specify rates, thresholds, timelines, or recovery mechanisms.

It applies only to systems that previously satisfied the First Law of Congruity.

---

## Relation to Other Laws

The Second Law does not contradict conservation laws, thermodynamics, or domain-specific decay principles.

It specifies the structural condition under which such laws manifest as degradation rather than stable transformation.

---

## Canonical Status

This law defines the necessary consequences of incongruity.

Operational interpretations belong to domain-specific frameworks and are explicitly excluded from the canonical layer.
