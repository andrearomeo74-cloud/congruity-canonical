# The First Law of Congruity

## Law (v1.0)

An outcome becomes admissible to a system if and only if the system can sustain it without loss of internal coherence across capacity, cost, scale, and consequence.

---

## Corollary I — No Causal Power of Intent

Intent alone has no causal power.  
Intent becomes effective only when embedded in a congruent structure.

---

## Corollary II — Inadmissibility Is Not Failure

A blocked outcome is not a failure, but an integrity-preserving constraint.

---

## Corollary III — Moral Neutrality

Congruity is value-neutral.  
It neither rewards nor punishes — it filters.

---

## Corollary IV — Scale Invariance

Congruity applies identically across domains and scales.  
The law is invariant; only the content changes.

---

## Corollary V — No Free Amplification

No outcome can exceed the system’s ability to absorb its downstream consequences.

---

## Minimal Canonical Form

An event E is admissible if and only if the system can sustain its capacity, cost, scale, and consequences without loss of coherence.

---

## Canonical Statement

Reality does not respond to intention.  
It responds to structural admissibility.
