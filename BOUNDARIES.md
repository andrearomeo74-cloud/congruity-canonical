# Scope and Boundaries of the Congruity Canonical Law

This repository defines the Congruity Canonical Law as a **foundational, non-operational principle**.
Its purpose is structural coherence, not implementation.

## What This Law Is
- A conceptual law of proportional coherence.
- A regime-agnostic admissibility condition.
- A unifying constraint across domains (physics, biology, cognition, systems).
- A framing principle that precedes models, metrics, and optimization.

## What This Law Is Not
- Not a physical theory.
- Not a clinical or therapeutic framework.
- Not a predictive or executable model.
- Not an optimization algorithm.
- Not a replacement for existing scientific theories (e.g., GR, QM, biology).

## No New Ontology
The law introduces **no new entities**, constants, forces, or mechanisms.
It does not posit hidden variables or alternative physical substrates.

## Non-Operational Nature
This repository intentionally avoids:
- Thresholds
- Metrics
- Simulations
- Empirical claims
- Prescriptive actions

All operational, experimental, or applied interpretations belong in downstream repositories.

## Relation to Other Repositories
All other Congruity-related repositories represent **applications, interpretations, or explorations** of this canonical law under specific regimes.
They are explicitly downstream and non-canonical.

## Legal and Ethical Boundary
This work is theoretical and conceptual only.
It must not be interpreted as medical, engineering, financial, or policy advice.
