# The Law of Congruity  
### A Structural Framework for Admissibility in Complex Systems

Congruity is a structural law describing **which system states and transitions are admissible** under proportional constraints.

It does not predict outcomes.
It does not optimize performance.
It defines **what can exist, persist, or scale without collapse**.

This repository contains the canonical, non-operational formulation of the Law of Congruity.

## What Problem Congruity Addresses

Modern systems fail not because they lack intelligence, data, or control,
but because they perform **inadmissible moves**:
transitions that violate proportional constraints between
energy, information, structure, and value.

Congruity provides a grammar to identify those violations *before* collapse.

---

## What Congruity Is

- A **law of admissibility**, not an algorithm
- A **structural grammar**, not a predictive model
- A **regime-based framework**, not an optimization method
- A **boundary theory** for complex systems

Congruity operates upstream of implementation, policy, or computation.

---

## What Congruity Is Not

- Not a simulation
- Not a machine learning model
- Not a control system
- Not a metaphysical theory

Congruity does not tell systems *what to do*.
It defines *what they are allowed to do*.

---

## Domains of Application

Congruity applies wherever systems exhibit collapse, saturation, or incoherent scaling, including:

- Artificial Intelligence & Agentic Systems
- Biology, Aging, and Systemic Disease
- Cognition, Decision-Making, and Agency
- Physics (quantum, cosmological, boundary problems)
- Energy, Infrastructure, and Logistics
- Economics, Finance, and Organizational Systems

## Structure of This Repository

- `CANON.md` — Canonical grammar of admissible states and transitions  
- `BOUNDARIES.md` — Structural boundary conditions and collapse regimes  
- `README.md` — Full canonical formulation  

Extensions, applications, and examples are deliberately maintained in separate repositories.

---

## Status

This repository defines the **canonical layer** of Congruity.

It is:
- Stable
- Non-operational
- Upstream of implementation
- Independent of technology stack

---

## Contact & Use

Congruity is intended to be **recognized, not adopted**.

Those able to apply it will know where it fits.

No implementation guidance is provided here by design.
