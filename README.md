# Congruity Canonical Framework

This repository defines the **canonical, non-operational grammar** of the Law of Congruity.

It does not propose models, equations, predictions, or implementations.
It defines **structural admissibility conditions** under which systems remain coherent, stable, and legitimate.

The Law of Congruity is treated here as a **foundational admissibility principle**, not as a control rule, optimization target, or predictive theory.

This repository defines the canonical laws of Congruity. The First Law is stated in `first-law-of-congruity.md`.

## Admissibility Condition

Congruity is not proposed as a physical law, a causal mechanism, or a predictive theory.

It is a **condition of admissibility**:  
a minimal proportional constraint that determines whether a system, model, or explanation is *coherent enough to exist or persist*.

Only systems whose expressed value (V) remains proportionate to their energetic (E), informational (I), and structural (S) costs are admissible.

All domain-specific applications — physical, biological, cognitive, or social — are secondary instantiations of this constraint.

For a minimal formal treatment of admissibility, see:

## Scope and Intent

This repository is:

- Conceptual and meta-theoretical
- Domain-agnostic
- Non-operational
- Non-predictive
- Non-executable

It provides:
- Canonical definitions
- Structural axioms
- Invariants
- Boundary conditions
- Admissibility logic

It explicitly **does not** provide:
- Formulas for computation
- Thresholds for decisions
- Empirical claims
- Domain-specific models
- Therapeutic, engineering, or policy prescriptions

## Position of the Law

The Law of Congruity does not replace existing physical, biological, or informational laws.

Instead, it specifies **when such laws remain admissible**, and when coherence degrades due to loss of proportionality between:

- Energy
- Information
- Structure
- Functional Value

## Structure of this Repository

- `CANON.md` — Canonical definition of Congruity
- `AXIOMS.md` — Foundational axioms
- `INVARIANTS.md` — Cross-domain invariants
- `ADMISSIBILITY.md` — Conditions of validity and breakdown
- `BOUNDARIES.md` — Explicit scope limits
- `IP_NOTICE.md` — Intellectual property and use restrictions
- `STATUS.md` — Maturity and intent
- `BOUNDARIES-OF-CONGRUITY.md – Canonical limits of applicability

---

## Status

This is a **canonical foundation**.
It is intentionally minimal, stable, and conservative.

Evolution occurs downstream, not here.
