# The Law of Congruity — Canonical Statement

A system is admissible if and only if its capability remains proportional to its cost, scale, and consequence.

Where proportionality breaks, instability emerges.
Where instability persists, compensatory structures arise.
Where compensation accumulates, collapse or reorganization follows.

Congruity is not an optimization objective.
It is an admissibility condition.

This law does not prescribe mechanisms, implementations, or interventions.
It defines the boundary between coherent and incoherent systems.

The Law of Congruity applies across domains:
biological, cognitive, artificial, economic, physical, and cosmological.
