# Boundaries of the Law of Congruity

This document defines the strict boundaries of applicability of the Law of Congruity.

These boundaries are not empirical limitations, but logical and structural limits
beyond which the Law ceases to be informative, meaningful, or admissible.

The Law of Congruity does not fail beyond these boundaries.
It becomes undefined.

---

## 1. Non-Operational Boundary

The Law of Congruity does not provide:

- algorithms,
- computational procedures,
- optimization rules,
- control mechanisms,
- executable decision logic.

Any attempt to operationalize the Law directly exceeds its canonical scope.

---

## 2. Non-Predictive Boundary

The Law of Congruity does not generate predictions.

It does not forecast outcomes, trajectories, or events.
It specifies conditions of admissibility and coherence only.

Predictive use requires external models not contained within this framework.

---

## 3. Temporal Admissibility Boundary (Arrow of Time)

This section formalizes the arrow of time as a congruity-based admissibility constraint.

Forward temporal evolution is admissible because energy, information, and structural costs
accumulate proportionally.

Future travel remains admissible under Congruity.
Past-directed trajectories violate proportionality and are therefore inadmissible,
independently of causality or local physical allowances.

## 4. Closed Timelike Curves and Temporal Loop Boundary

The Law of Congruity is not defined for closed timelike curves (CTCs),
temporal loops, or self-referential time trajectories.

Such structures violate proportionality by allowing value (V)
to be preserved, duplicated, or amplified without corresponding
energetic (E), informational (I), or structural (S) cost accumulation.

In a closed temporal loop, costs cannot grow monotonically,
while functional value may persist across cycles.
This breaks the minimal proportional ordering required for admissibility.

Therefore, temporal loops and backward-closed trajectories are
structurally inadmissible under Congruity,
independently of whether local physical theories permit their existence.

No causal paradox is required.
The inadmissibility arises purely from loss of proportional cost ordering.

Conceptual boundary only.
No claim is made regarding physical realizability.

## 5. Wormhole and Metric Shortcut Boundary

The Law of Congruity does not forbid non-local spatial connections
such as wormholes or metric shortcuts per se.

However, such structures are admissible only if the apparent reduction
in spatial or temporal distance is compensated by corresponding
structural (S), energetic (E), or informational (I) cost at a deeper level.

Apparent efficiency gains that reduce operational scale
without incurring real structural cost violate proportionality.

Hidden or deferred costs are not exempt.
Structural cost must be globally accounted across the system.

Therefore, any wormhole-like shortcut that enables sustained functional value (V)
without proportional accumulation of total cost (E + I + S)
is inadmissible under Congruity.

Conceptual boundary only.
No claim is made regarding physical realizability.

## 6. Identity and Subject Continuity Boundary

The Law of Congruity does not assume or define personal identity,
consciousness, or subjectivity.

However, any attribution of functional value (V) to a system across
time, space, or state transitions requires structural continuity.

If informational structure (I), energetic embodiment (E),
or organizational constraints (S) are disrupted beyond recoverable limits,
the system cannot be treated as the same subject for value attribution.

Transfer of value without continuity of identity is inadmissible,
even if functional outputs appear similar.

Therefore, any process — including time displacement, teleportation,
duplication, or reconstruction — that breaks subject continuity
invalidates proportional value claims under Congruity.

This boundary is structural, not metaphysical.
No claims are made about consciousness itself.

## 7. Non-Therapeutic and Non-Clinical Boundary

The Law of Congruity is not:

- a medical theory,
- a clinical framework,
- a therapeutic guideline,
- a diagnostic or treatment protocol.

Any application to biological or medical domains requires independent empirical
validation and domain-specific methodologies outside this law.

---

## 8. Domain-Indeterminate Boundary

The Law of Congruity applies only to systems where all of the following can be
meaningfully defined:

- energetic cost,
- informational structure,
- structural constraints,
- functional value.

Systems lacking one or more of these dimensions fall outside its scope.

---

## 9. Chaos and Non-Stationarity Boundary

The Law of Congruity is not defined for systems that are:

- purely chaotic with no stable scale relations,
- non-stationary with continuously collapsing reference frames,
- dominated by noise without persistent structure.

In such cases, proportionality cannot be evaluated.

---

## 10. Normative and Moral Boundary

The Law of Congruity does not prescribe:

- ethical norms,
- moral values,
- political directives,
- social or legal obligations.

It is structurally descriptive, not normatively prescriptive.

---

## 11. Symbolic-Only Systems Boundary

Purely symbolic or abstract systems without real cost, energy, or consequence
do not satisfy the conditions for congruity evaluation.

Symbolic coherence alone is not sufficient.

---

## Canonical Closure

Within these boundaries, the Law of Congruity is admissible and well-defined.
Beyond them, it neither applies nor asserts.

This limitation is intentional and foundational.
