# Status of the Canonical Law of Congruity

This repository defines the **canonical formulation** of the Law of Congruity.

The framework is intentionally **complete, closed, and non-evolving** in its canonical form.

---

## Canonical Status

- Status: **Canonical**
- Maturity: **Final**
- Evolution: **Frozen**
- Scope: **Foundational / Meta-theoretical**
- Nature: **Non-operational**

The contents of this repository establish the **reference definition** of the Law of Congruity.

---

## Non-Evolution Clause

No further expansion, refinement, optimization, or extension of the Law of Congruity occurs within this repository.

Any future work—applications, interpretations, models, metrics, simulations, or domain-specific developments—must occur **outside** this canonical definition and must explicitly reference it without modifying it.

---
## Canonical Status — Version 1.0

This repository is frozen as the canonical reference implementation of the
Law of Congruity.

Version 1.0 defines the complete admissibility structure, boundaries, and
closure conditions of the law.

No new domains, mechanisms, or extensions will be added here.
All future developments occur strictly downstream in application-specific
or exploratory repositories.

This canonical layer exists to remain stable, minimal, and non-evolving.


## Relationship to Other Repositories

All other Congruity-related repositories are:

- Derived
- Interpretative
- Contextual
- Domain-specific
- Non-canonical

They do **not** redefine the Law of Congruity.

This repository is the **single source of canonical truth**.

---

## Versioning

This canonical definition does not use semantic versioning.

There is no v1, v2, or later revision.

The Law of Congruity is defined here as a **foundational admissibility principle**, independent of implementation or time.

---

## Final Declaration

The Law of Congruity is considered **fully stated** at the canonical level.

No additions are required.
No revisions are expected.

This repository is closed by design.
